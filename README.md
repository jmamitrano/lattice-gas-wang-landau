# 2D Lattice Gas — Wang-Landau Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo study of a 2D lattice gas model, mapped exactly from the 2D
Ising model, using the **Wang-Landau algorithm** to compute the joint
density of states g(E, N) and, from it, the full grand-canonical
thermodynamics of the system — including its first-order phase transition
and phase diagram — from a single simulation.

## 1. Physical background

### The lattice gas / Ising mapping

Each site of an L x L square lattice (periodic boundary conditions) carries
an occupation number `n_i in {0, 1}`. Occupied nearest-neighbor pairs lower
the energy, and a chemical potential `mu` controls the average density:

```
H(n) = -eps * sum_<ij> n_i * n_j  -  mu * sum_i n_i
```

This is exactly the 2D Ising model in disguise, via `n_i = (1 + s_i) / 2`,
with `eps = 4J` and `mu = 2h - 8J` (J = spin coupling, h = external field).

### The particle-hole symmetric point

Applying `n_i -> 1 - n_i` (swapping occupied and empty sites) maps the
system onto itself, energy for energy, only at one special value of the
chemical potential:

```
mu = -2 * eps
```

At that point the model is exactly symmetric between the dilute (empty)
and dense (full) phases — the direct analogue of zero external field in
the Ising model. It can be shown (see the derivation this project is based
on) that at `mu = -2*eps`:

* `<N>(T) = L**2 / 2` for **every** temperature, exactly.
* The grand-canonical specific heat `Cv(T, mu) = d<H>/dT` (with
  `H = E - mu*N`, not `E` alone — see §3) is exactly mirror-symmetric
  about `mu = -2*eps`.

This symmetric point is where the model's genuine (first-order, becoming
critical at Tc) phase transition lives, and it is the mu = -2*eps value
used as the anchor throughout this project.

### Onsager's exact result

For the 2D square lattice, Onsager's exact solution gives:

```
k_B * Tc / J = 2 / ln(1 + sqrt(2))  ~  2.269
```

With `eps = 4J` and `k_B = 1`, this is `Tc / eps ~ 0.567`. Every Tc
estimate in this project is compared against that exact value; the small
residual deviation is the finite-size effect expected for a finite L.

## 2. Method: why Wang-Landau instead of plain Metropolis

Plain (grand-canonical) Metropolis samples configurations proportionally
to their Boltzmann weight, at one fixed (T, mu). Two things make it a poor
fit for mapping out this system's full phase diagram:

1. **Cost.** A conventional Metropolis run only gives good statistics at
   the single (T, mu) point it was run at. Exploring a grid of, say,
   1000 x 1000 (T, mu) points — as this project does — would require a
   million independent simulations.
2. **Trapping near the first-order transition.** Close to coexistence
   (mu ~ -2*eps, T < Tc), the dilute and dense phases are separated by a
   free-energy barrier of rare intermediate configurations. Because
   Metropolis avoids low-probability states by design, it gets trapped in
   one phase for a time that grows exponentially with system size, instead
   of sampling both phases.

Wang-Landau sidesteps both problems. It builds a **flat histogram in
(E, N) space** rather than sampling by Boltzmann weight, using an
acceptance rule based on the (still unconverged) density of states itself:

```
accept  with probability  min(1, g(E_old, N_old) / g(E_new, N_new))
```

This actively pushes the random walk toward under-visited states,
including the rare configurations that bridge the two phases — which is
exactly what defeats Metropolis. The one simulation produces g(E, N),
independent of T and mu, from which **any** thermodynamic quantity at
**any** (T, mu) — or an entire grid of both — is a cheap post-processing
sum, with no further simulation required.

## 3. A subtlety: Cv means d\<H\>/dT, not d\<E\>/dT

Away from the symmetric point, `d<E>/dT` at fixed mu (E = bond energy
alone) is *not* guaranteed non-negative — and in this project's grand
canonical map it visibly goes negative near the coexistence line. This is
not a bug: the thermodynamic guarantee of a non-negative specific heat
applies to `Var(H)/T**2`, where `H = E - mu*N` is the *full* grand
Hamiltonian (a genuine variance, hence non-negative by construction), not
to a variance of `E` alone. The two only coincide when `<N>` does not
depend on T, which is exactly the situation at the symmetric point
`mu = -2*eps` (see §1). Every Cv reported here is computed from
`H = E - mu*N`.

```

`1D_wang_landau.ipynb` is the first, simpler version of the project: a
single-variable Wang-Landau walk over the total grand energy
`H = -eps*bonds - mu*N`, with `mu` fixed from the start. It was used to
validate the method (correct Tc, correct Cv(T) peak) before extending it
to the full 2D version.

`2D_wang_landau.ipynb` is the main result: a joint random walk over
`(E, N)`, with `E` the bond energy alone. `mu` is not fixed during the
simulation — it is a free parameter introduced only when building the
grand-canonical partition function `Xi(T, mu)` afterwards, which is what
makes it possible to explore the full (T, mu) phase diagram from one run.

All results below are for an 8x8 lattice (`eps = 1`, `k_B = 1`).

### Density of states and visit histogram

The joint density of states g(E, N) and the Wang-Landau visit histogram,
both restricted to the (E, N) region the random walk actually reached — a
diagonal band, since the bond energy at fixed N is bounded by how densely
those N particles can be packed:

</p>

### Specific heat Cv(T) at mu = -2\*eps

Computed two independent ways — the 1D walk (mu fixed in the simulation
itself) and the 2D walk (mu introduced in post-processing) — and they
agree:

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/1D_Cv_vs_T.png" width="420">
  <img src="figures/2D_Cv_vs_T_fixed_mu.png" width="420">
</p>

Both give **Tc ~ 0.589**, versus the exact Onsager value of 0.567 (~4%
finite-size deviation for L=8, in the expected direction).

### The first-order transition: \<N\>(mu)

At `T = 1.0` (above Tc ~ 0.589), the crossover from the dilute to the
dense phase is smooth, with no discontinuity — as expected, since there is
no phase transition above Tc:

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/2D_meanN_vs_mu_aboveTc.png" width="480">
</p>

The inflection point still sits almost exactly on the symmetric value,
`mu_c ~ -1.998` (theory: -2.000) — a third, independent confirmation of
the same critical point, this time located via the mu-axis rather than
the T-axis.

### The full (T, mu) phase diagram

Repeating the Cv and \<N\> calculations over a full grid of (T, mu) — a
cheap post-processing sweep over the single precomputed g(E, N) table —
reconstructs the complete phase diagram:

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/2D_Cv_phase_diagram.png" width="420">
  <img src="figures/2D_meanN_phase_diagram.png" width="420">
</p>

The Cv map shows the classic shape of a first-order line terminating at a
critical point: a narrow, tall ridge of large fluctuations running along
`mu = -2*eps` for T < Tc, closing to a single point exactly at
`(Tc, -2*eps)`, and no structure at all for T > Tc. The companion
\<N\>(T, mu) map shows the same story directly in the order parameter: a
sharp jump between the dilute and dense phases below Tc, smoothing into a
continuous crossover above it.

## 7. Physical interpretation

The lattice gas language maps directly onto a real, measurable system:
adsorption of a gas onto a crystal surface. `mu` is the chemical potential
of the surrounding gas reservoir (set experimentally by its pressure at
fixed T), and `<N>(mu)` is the surface's adsorption isotherm. The sharp
jump found here is a first-order **condensation** of the adsorbed layer —
an abrupt jump in surface coverage at a critical pressure — and the same
model, in its original spin language, describes the discontinuous jump in
magnetization of a ferromagnet as an external field crosses zero below its
Curie temperature.
